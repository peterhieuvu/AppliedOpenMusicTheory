# Content Roadmap

This is a list of topics that may be covered in the future. Keep in mind that this file will only account for specific content ideas. Broader and more general ideas will be in `TODO.md` instead. The content roadmap is more intended to be a way to map out ideas that will probably be covered at some point, as well as what chapter they might fall under. 

All chapters will be listed even though there might not be an active task since there might be additional ideas that we decide (or have been asked to) include in previous chapters. Uncategorized Topics is a section for items that we would like to cover in the future, but have not decided a chapter that it belongs in.
