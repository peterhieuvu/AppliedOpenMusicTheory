# AppliedOpenMusicTheory
An open source book on applied music theory!

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated fairly frequently. The current state of the book can be viewed in `build/OpenAppliedMusicTheory.pdf` although keep in mind that there are many placeholders and unfinished ideas.
