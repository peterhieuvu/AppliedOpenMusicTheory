    \sfchapter{The basics}{1}

    If you've never played a musical instrument and have never been involved in music, I'm not sure how you found this book, but we will gloss over the basics. I will recommend https://www.musictheory.net/ as a better resource for introductory theory. We are not affiliated in any way, but it may be a bit better than just reading through this. In practice, there might be a bit of overlap between that website and this book for the first few chapters. The approaches are different, but in any case, I encourage you to checkout different resources. Different things work for different people. If you decide this book doesn't work well for you, I won't be offended :) But if you don't mind, it would be nice to know what didn't work and maybe how we could improve the book!
