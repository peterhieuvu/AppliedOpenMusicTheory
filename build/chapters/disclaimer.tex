    This book is currently in a highly volatile state. You might be reading something and tomorrow when you check the latest version, the whole book might be backwards. As I am about to start the real content of the book, chapters are probably going to be very out of order and content and examples may be missing. The main goal of this period of development is to just begin to get stuff down on paper. This is not a finished product. Well it might never be truly "finished", but this is not something that is ready to be "published" you might say. In any case, thank you for showing interest in this book so early on! If you have anything you'd like to say, please let me know!
