# TODO List and Roadmap

This is a list of tasks for anything except for specific content ideas. Those are instead going to be found in `CONTENT.md`.

- [ ] Refactor everything for better organization

- [ ] Contact info

- [ ] Copyright and license, very important

- [ ] Consider LilyPond for examples

- [ ] Consider labeling subsections too

- [ ] Explain and go over bold vocab words

- [ ] Consider how to organize chapters to give a good overview of content, but also not clutter up the table of contents too much

- [ ] Borders for checkpoint system and possibly asides/fun facts
    - To make it look more interesting :)

- [ ] Refine Chapter 0 (Preface vs Meta)
    - Preface
    - Meta
        - Chapter layout
        - Chapters may be different lengths

- [ ] Reference System
    - Clickable links
    - Links for checkpoint
    - At the very least clickable table of contents

- [ ] Better colors for aside and checkpoint

- [ ] Consider change of structure to more, but shorter chapters, and parts to separate groups of chapters.

- [ ] Consistent usage of, we, I, this book, you, and the reader

- [ ] Make a contribution guide to lay out conventions and styles

# Completed

- [x] Better title and chapter heading formats

- [x] Headers and footers

- [x] Consider checkpoint system like my physics book

- [x] Change Chapter 1 so that it introduces notation separately from the meanings behind the notation

- [x] Content Roadmap/TODO
    - Separate place to put ideas regarding content 
    - This document remains a place for the ideas regarding the book that don't have to do with content
