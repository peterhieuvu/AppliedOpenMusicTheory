# TODO List and Roadmap

- [ ] Refactor everything for better organization

- [ ] Contact info

- [ ] Copyright and license, very important

- [ ] Consider LilyPond for examples

- [ ] Consider labeling subsections too

- [ ] Explain and go over bold vocab words

- [ ] Consider how to organize chapters to give a good overview of content, but also not clutter up the table of contents too much

- [ ] Borders for checkpoint system and possibly asides/fun facts
    - To make it look more interesting :)

- [ ] Preface vs Meta
    - Preface
    - Meta
        - Chapter layout
        - Chapters may be different lengths

- [ ] Reference System
    - Clickable links
    - At the very least clickable table of contents

- [ ] Content Roadmap/TODO
    - Separate place to put ideas regarding content 
    - This document remains a place for the ideas regarding the book that don't have to do with content
