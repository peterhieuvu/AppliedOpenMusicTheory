## TODO List and Roadmap

* Better title and chapter heading formats

* Refactor everything for better organization

* Headers and footers

* Contact info

* Copy right and license, very important

* Consider LilyPond for examples

* Consider labeling subsections too

* Explain and go over bold vocab words

* Consider how to organize chapters to give a good overview of content, but also not clutter up the table of contents too much

* Consider checkpoint system like my physics book

* Preface vs Meta
    -Preface
    -Meta
        -Chapter layout
        -Chapters may be different lengths

* Reference System
    -Clickable links
    -At the very least clickable table of contents
